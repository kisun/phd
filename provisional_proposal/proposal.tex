\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}



% This document is a template that can be edited by the student.
% Fill in the details as you go along and delete these instructions.
% Do have your research proposal scrutinized by your supervisor before
% submitting it to the department.



% Give a few paragraphs here on the general background
% to your research proposal; put the full details in
% Section~\ref{sec:background}. You might want to cite a few
% previous important results/papers. Describe any theory briefly
% here but put most of the details in Section~\ref{sec:background}.
% Describe any data in general with a few lines here but put the
% full details in Section~\ref{sec:data}.


% Motivate this section well \ldots why is the topic important?
% What use will the thesis have?
% What is unknown that will be known upon completion?


% This section should be understandable by an intelligent person
% who is not familiar with the technical details involved.
% The reader should be convinced that your work
% is worthwhile.





% Some of our PhD students have published in the primary literature
% directly using material from their thesis,
% e.g.,
% \cite{wors:1979},
% \cite{yee:wild:1996},
% \cite{wild:yee:1996},
% \cite{murr:1999},
% \cite{jian:scot:wild:2006},
% \cite{roev:meye:etal:2007},
% \cite{mill:stew:2007},
% or submitted such as
% \cite{lee:hiro:2008}.
% Ideally you should aim at least one of your publications towards
% a mainstream statistics journal, preferably your first one.
% All publications should be in a peer-reviewed international journal.
% It should be in the primary literature.
% Statistical theory and methodology is to be regarded as the highest
% form of quality output.
% Accompanying high quality software that can easily be used
% by others (such as a R package) is also good.
% It is best to submit to journals before the completion of a thesis
% because an acceptance validates the quality of that research.



% A word about writing up your thesis.
% In general, the Department of Statistics recommends \LaTeX{} rather than
% Microsoft Word.
% \LaTeX{} is easily run on the Department's Linux machines.
% A website that converts pdf into Word is \textsf{www.pdftoword.com}.
% The University of Auckland offers a half-day workshop
% on \LaTeX{} to postgraduate students.
% There is Sweave \citep{lmucs-papers:Leisch:2003b} which allows R
% \citep{R:Ihaka+Gentleman:1996} to be embedded into a \LaTeX{}
% document, and so the output does not have to be manually
% cut-and-pasted in. Sweave is useful for presentations too,
% in conjunction with Beamer.


% There is an editor called Emacs which is useful for all types of
% editing, including \LaTeX{}, C, and R.
% In Windows there is Tinn-R for R files and MiKTeX for \LaTeX{}.


% Note that {BibTeX} items are available from MathSciNet
% which is part of the ``Library Databases'' in the UoA electronic library
% system.
% There is a close relationship between EndNote and {BibTeX}.




In many cities, public transport is important to management and traffic etc.
For commuters, knowledge of expected waiting times is useful for both trip planning,
as well as reducing frustration at waiting for long periods of time.


Over the years, many technologies have been added to transit vehicles---such as 
automatic vehicle positioning (AVL) systems---which are used to provide commuters with
up-to-date information on the location and, more importantly, expected arrival time of their bus.


Many applications have been produced to present this information to commuters, and many different methods
for generating this information have been used.
Notable methods are the Kalman Filter \citep{cathey-dailey:2003}, \ldots


The main problem is efficiency.
The resulting algorithm must be able to update the predictions quickly, 
to reduce the time between receiving a vehicle location, and getting predictions to commuters.
This can be difficult when there are a lot of busses (the Auckland Transport service has up to $N$ 
busses operating simultaneously at peak traffic times).
Additionally, new locations are recieved every 10--30~seconds, 
so the predictions will constantly need updating as new information arrives.



Additionally, the predictions supplied to commuters can be terribly inaccurate.
In the Auckland Transport system, common phenomena include ``time travelling busses'', 
where the ETA increses significantly (from, for example, 5~minutes to 15~minutes), 
or ``disappearing busses'' that display a realistic ETA, leading to ``DUE'', 
and finally removed from the board without the bus having gone past.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}


% Background knowledge is crucial, therefore describe it fully here.
% Specify the background to the problems you are trying to solve.
% Define anything technical that most statisticians will not be
% familiar with.


% What previous work has been done in the area?
% Cite references relating to such work, e.g.,
% in the form of \cite{reid:2003} and \cite{efro:tibs:1993}.
% Has anybody described any open problems in the literature?


% Make sure that problems arising from the background knowledge
% are clearly described. There should be a logical flow of thought
% in this section starting from the background and leading to the
% problem on hand.




% Don't put anything new in this section.


Describe AVL.


Kalman Filter - how? why? examples, pros \& cons.

\section{So What's New?}
\label{sec:whatsnew}



% List \textit{specific} and \textit{new} results that your thesis
% plans to obtain, especially with regard to new statistical theory
% and methodology.
% It is essential that you have provided comprehensive background
% (in Section~\ref{sec:background})
% so that it is clear what new contributions will be made (here),
% and how they will extend what is currently known.
% Tie these with Appendix~A(i), and a list such as below is a
% good idea.


% For example, all of the points below are new (to my knowledge)
% and have not been done yet.
% \begin{enumerate}

% \item
% Develop a new method for quantile regression based on the
% asymmetric Laplace distribution and the concept of link functions
% and parallelism assumptions (via constraint matrices).


% \item
% Derive the asymptotic properties of the above method,
% both as $n \rightarrow \infty$ and as $p \rightarrow \infty$.




% \item
% Conduct a small simulation to check the mean squared error and
% other properties. To be done in R with some sections written in~C
% calling LINPACK \citep{dong:bunc:mole:stew:1979} for additional speed.



% \item
% Compare my results to those of~\cite{wei:carr:2009}, especially
% relating to boundary effects and small-sample properties.



% \item
% Tackle an important dataset or problem that no one has
% satisfactorily resolved before. It is essential that new
% methodologies are investigated and that novel insights are
% obtained. Note that a conventional analysis, even of a very large
% dataset, is \textit{not} PhD-level research.


% \end{enumerate}







% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Data and Special Needs}
\label{sec:data}


% Almost all Statistics PhD theses should analyse at least one
% data set, even if it is a toy data set.


% State their source fully.
% If new data is important to the thesis describe what's new.
% Why is this data set important?
% What is novel about it?
% Specify any ethics or confidentiality issues.


% A plot of some of the data may be useful;
% see Figure~\ref{fig:myfig}.


% Do you have any special needs such as IT needs?
% These include hardware (supercomputing facilities),
% and expertise/technical knowledge.
% Often extra large data sets have special needs associated
% with its processing.
% How do you invisage those needs to be met?



% Funding: anything to report here?
% If your thesis work involves experiments, travel or special
% resources in order to collect data, or essential collaboration with
% experts in your field, then you should describe these requirements
% here along with how you, or your supervisor, will fund these
% requirements. Departments work on tightly planned budgets and
% generally do not have the facilities to pay for unplanned PhD
% related expenses.



% If ethics approval(s)/permissions is needed then put
% any details here.

% I did STATS~730 in Semester~1 of 2010 and obtained an A+.


% \item
% I did STATS~782 in Semester~2 of 2010 and obtained an A.
