# Literature Review

## Modeling Techniques

### Kalman Filtering

Used by:
- Dailey et al. (2001);

Data requirements:
- Realtime AVL data (e.g., GTFS-Realtime)
- Historical statistics


### ANN: Artificial Neural Network

Used by:
- X



### SVN:

Used by:
- Y


### Papers

#### Dailey et al. (2004): "Transit Vehicle Arrival Prediction"

Use of the Kalman Filter to predict the arrival of buses, based off of AVL data, at but stops (up to 1 hour in advance).

- Time to arrival function:
$$\bar T_a\left(x\right) = \frac{x}{\bar s\left(x\right)}$$
- $\bar s\left(x\right)$ is the speed _assuming constant speed_ from location $x$ to the destination
- estimate $\bar s\left(x\right)$ by a piecewise constant model using observed distance/time until arrival data
- Points over the $k$th interval of size $\delta x_k$ (about $x_k$) assumed uniformally distribution over the region, $\bar T_a\left(x_k\right)$ computed using mean temporal (time until arrival) values
$$\bar s_k = \frac{x_k}{\bar T_a\left(x_k\right)}$$
- $\bar s_k$ is essentially the slope of the line from the centroid to the observed distance/time data pairs
- $\bar s\left(x\right) = \bar s_k$
- deviation from presumed linear behavior is assumed normal; tested using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (see paper for details, pp. 47)

Once assumptions are verified, Algorithm is outlined

- state variables at the $k$th step:
$$X_k = \begin{bmatrix}x_k\\t_k\\b_k\end{bmatrix} = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
\text{vehicle location}\\\text{the time}\\\text{time until arrival}
\end{array}\right.$$
