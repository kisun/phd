Studies have shown that an arrival-time countdown at bus stops
can reduce passengers' percieved waiting times;
of course, this assumes some level of accuracy in the predictions.
For a variety of reasons, this is not often the case.
We present an approach to arrival time prediction that,
rather than modeling only a single vehicle or route, 
takes into account all other transit vehicles in the area.
Using a particle filter (PF) in real-time to model the state (location and speed) 
of all buses in Auckland, we generate a "map" of current traffic conditions for all bus routes,
which is updated using a Kalman filter (KF).
This in turn is used to refine the particle filter estimates for subsequent buses.
To make arrival time predictions, we use the KF state estimates to compute
a vehicle's arrival time at all remaining stops, independently for each particle.
This generates a distribution of plausible arrival times accounting for uncertainty,
such as from traffic lights and time spent at stops dropping off and picking up passengers.
To communicate uncertainty to passengers,
we consider using prediction intervals ("2-5 minutes")
rather than point estimates ("3 minutes"),
both of which are straightforward to obtain from the PF sample.
